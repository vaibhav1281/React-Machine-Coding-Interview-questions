The line `setTodo([...todo, {text: input, id: Date.now()}])` is updating the state of the `todo` array by adding a new todo item to it. Here's how it works:

- `...todo`: This is the spread operator (`...`). It creates a new array that contains all of the existing elements in the `todo` array. This is necessary because in React, state should not be modified directly. Instead, a new copy should be made and then set with the state setter function (`setTodo` in this case).

- `{text: input, id: Date.now()}`: This is the new todo item that is being added. It's an object that contains two properties: `text` and `id`. The `text` property is set to the current value of the `input` state, which is the text of the new todo item. The `id` property is set to the current timestamp (`Date.now()`), which gives a unique id to each todo item.

- `setTodo([...todo, {text: input, id: Date.now()}])`: This is calling the `setTodo` function (which is the state setter function returned by `useState`) with the new array. This updates the state of the `todo` array to include the new todo item.

So, in summary, this line is adding a new todo item with the current input text and a unique id to the todo list. After this line runs, the `todo` state will be an array that includes all of the previous todo items plus the new one. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
